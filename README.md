# PTTChatBot_DL2017

## Introdution
In one of the course assignments, we have experimented with RNN to generate and process text sequences. It was a very interesting experience and motivated us to study whether it is possible to train talkshow chatbots.
In order to build chatbots capable of handling a wide range to topics, we trained our chatbots using the Chinese corpus from two of the PTT gossip forums: Gossiping and Women Talk. Both forums have their own styles of opinionated expressions. We aim to create chatbots to deliver quarrelsome or sarcastic responds to input queries.
